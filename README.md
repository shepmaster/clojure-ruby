# clojure-ruby

A Clojure program to interpret a **very** narrow subset of Ruby.

Written for the [Reddit daily programmer][rdp] challenge

## Usage

```
lein run path-to-ruby-code.rb
```

Remember that it's unlikely that any arbitrary Ruby code will work. An
`example.rb` file is included that should work, but you should try the
Brainfuck interpreter from my other project, [ruby-brainfuck][rbbf].

There should be exceptions thrown for bad input, but they aren't very
easy to read!

## Thanks

Many thanks to the [instaparse][instaparse] library, which took care
of all the heavy lifting of parsing!
